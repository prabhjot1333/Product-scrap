# Product-scrap

I work for a company as business development associate, and they wanted us to make a list of the products on this website. They wanted a list of 2000 products which was tough for 2 people as it was not easy to copy a bunch of stuff, and our speed wasalmost 200 entries in 9-10 hrs.

So i got tired and in my own time i made this code to scrap the data for me.

Used selenium and BS4 for scrapping and made separate files, because list was 5200+ iteams and didnt wanted error after long run time.
